### üî≠ Research
My research area leverages persuasion and moral psychology as the theoretical backbone to understand entertainment media and the intersection between media technology and health. I advocate for replication and triangulation, integrating computational methods and brain imaging (fMRI) to better examine communicative phenomena. Notable research publications include:

- [Refining esports: A quantitative cartography of esports literature | Entertainment Computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952123000526)
- [Measures of argument strength: A computational, large-scale analysis of effective persuasion in real-world debates | Communication Methods and Measures](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19312458.2023.2230866)

### üå± Teaching
I firmly believe that the value of knowledge is best fostered through sharing. Teaching has always ignited my passion. Serving as the instructor of record for fundamental courses in communication, such as Science of Persuasion and Introduction to Communication, I draw inspiration from both my students and fellow instructors. It is my mission to master my craft in knowledge dissemination continuously.
